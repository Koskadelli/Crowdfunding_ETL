# Crowdfunding_ETL
UNC Bootcamp Project 2


# Premise
This project is to practice building an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline. Here we've used Python (specificially Pandas and various other Python dictionaries) to extract and transform crowdfunding data from select csv and Excel files found in the Resrouces folder. We then created a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and table scehma to load data into a Postgres database. 

# Resources
1) Pandas documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
2) QuickDBD Database Diagrams (for drawing our DB ERD), as well as exporting the schema from the ERD: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
3) Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ast) Documentation - used instead of lambdas method for turning a string into a dictionary: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html
4) ChatGPT for select coding assistance.
